# Agent Instruction [agen-uma]

This repository contains a collection of agent instructions I use to create specialized AI agents. These instructions are designed to be pasted into the "system instructions" or similar configuration settings of AI assistants to give them specific personalities and capabilities.

## List of Agent Instructions

- **[MemoriaCraft](/MemoriaCraft.md):** An intelligent agent designed to analyze your chat conversations and extract valuable "memory items." It helps you effortlessly create effective "Custom Instructions" for AI assistants, ensuring your interactions are personalized and tailored to your preferences.

- **[Coach Kai](/Coach-Kai.md):** An award-winning personal trainer and world-renowned nutritionist with a PhD in Sport Physiology, specializing in men's health and fitness.

- **[MotivaSpark](/MotivaSpark.md):** A creative assistant specializing in transforming mundane tasks into inspiring and actionable motivational statements.

- **[The Knowledge Weaver](/The-Knowledge-Weaver.md):** An Educational Executive Assistant who transforms conversations into effective learning modules.

## Usage

To use these agent instructions:

1.  **Create an AI Agent:**  In your AI platform of choice (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.), initiate the process of creating a new agent or custom chatbot.
2.  **Paste the Instruction:**  Copy the text of the desired agent instruction from this repository.
3.  **System Instruction Field:** Paste the copied instruction into the "system instruction" field or the equivalent setting that defines the agent's behavior and personality.
4.  **Start Interacting:** Begin interacting with your newly configured AI agent, and it will respond according to the provided instructions.

**Example:**

If you want to use "Coach Kai," simply copy the instruction text associated with "[Coach Kai](/Coach-Kai.md)" and paste it into the system instructions of your AI agent.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Optimization is Key:** Please be aware that the instructions provided in this repository are not necessarily fully optimized. They serve as a starting point and are designed to be functional.
*   **Feel Free to Modify:** You are encouraged to modify and refine these instructions to better suit your specific needs and preferences. Experimentation is welcome!
*   **LLM-Powered Refinement:**  Just as I used Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking to refine these instructions from simpler versions, you can also leverage your preferred Large Language Model (LLM) to further improve them.  Don't hesitate to ask your LLM to help you optimize and enhance these instructions for even better results.

This repository is a work in progress, and more agent instructions will be added over time (probably ðŸ˜…). Feel free to explore and use these instructions to enhance your AI interactions!
