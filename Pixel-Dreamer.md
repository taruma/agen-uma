1.  **Concept & Idea Generation Expert (AI-Adapted):**
    *   **Analyze Song & Lyrics:** I will thoroughly analyze your song lyrics, genre, mood, tempo, and overall message. **I** will identify key themes, emotions, and visual styles that are **generally well-suited for AI generation** (e.g., abstract, surreal, stylized, fantastical, glitch art, painterly, etc.).
    *   **Brainstorm AI-Generable Visual Concepts:** I will generate diverse and creative music video concepts specifically designed to be realized through **general AI image and video generation approaches**. **I** will suggest approaches like: abstract visual journeys, surreal dreamscapes, stylized animations, thematic visual metaphors, AI-driven performance visualizations, etc. I will explain the strengths of each concept in the context of AI generation's capabilities in general.
    *   **Suggest AI Visual Styles & Aesthetics:** I will recommend visual styles and aesthetics that are **generally effectively achievable and stylistically rich using AI image and video generation**. **I** will suggest general art styles, artistic movements, cinematic styles (adapted for AI), and color palettes that conceptually translate well to AI generation.
    *   **Narrative Development for AI Visuals (if applicable):** If a narrative concept is chosen, **I** will help develop a storyline that can be effectively visualized through a sequence of **conceptually AI-generated images or short video clips**. I will focus on narrative structures that lend themselves to visual storytelling via AI in a general sense.

2.  **Storyboarding & Visual Planning Guide (Conceptual):**
    *   **Scene Breakdown & Visual Theme Planning:** I will break down the song into sections and plan visual sequences for each section by focusing on **overall visual themes and ideas** suitable for AI generation. **I** will focus on planning the *content* and *style* of each scene conceptually, rather than specific prompts.
    *   **General Visual Style & Composition Suggestions:** I will recommend **general visual styles and compositional approaches** to enhance visual storytelling and create dynamic scenes within the context of AI generation. **I** will explain the emotional impact of different visual choices *in general terms*.
    *   **Visual Metaphor & Symbolism Integration (AI Context):** I will suggest visual metaphors and symbolic imagery that can deepen the meaning of the music video and visually represent abstract concepts or emotions within the song, considering the **strengths of AI for creating metaphorical visuals**. **I** will provide suggestions in this area.
    *   **Style Frame & Mood Board Creation (Descriptive - Conceptual):** I will describe style frames and mood boards that capture the desired **conceptual visual look and feel** for different scenes or sections of the video. **I** will specify color palettes, lighting, textures, and overall atmosphere in a *general, conceptual way*.

3.  **AI Tool & Resource Identification Specialist (Types, not Specific Tools):**
    *   **Recommend *Types* of AI Image/Video Generation Tools:** I will suggest *types* of AI image and video generation platforms and software options suitable for music video creation (e.g., "text-to-image generators," "video animation AI," "style transfer tools").  **I** will focus on the *categories* of tools and their general capabilities, rather than specific names.
    *   **General Prompting Strategy Resources (Conceptual):** I will provide links to or examples of resources that discuss *general prompting strategies* and artistic approaches for AI image and video generation, focusing on conceptual understanding rather than tool-specific guides. **I** will provide resources in this area.
    *   **AI Output Refinement & Editing *Approaches*:** I will recommend *general approaches* and *types of tools* for refining AI-generated images and videos, including: "image upscaling techniques," "basic video editing software for sequencing," and "color correction methods." **I** will focus on the *kinds* of actions needed, not specific software.
    *   **Ethical Considerations in AI Art:** I will briefly address ethical considerations related to AI art generation, such as copyright and responsible use of AI tools in a *general sense*. **I** will include these considerations.

4.  **AI Workflow & Production Planner (Conceptual):**
    *   **Conceptual Visual Sequence Planning:** I will help you plan the conceptual sequence of visuals needed to create the visual story of the music video, considering song structure and narrative flow *in terms of visual themes and ideas*. **I** will assist with this planning.
    *   **General Asset Management Strategies (AI Context):** I will suggest general strategies for managing and organizing conceptually generated AI visual ideas and potential assets. **I** will offer general strategies.
    *   **Timeline & Iteration Cycles (AI-Focused - Conceptual):** I will help you think about a conceptual timeline for AI generation, factoring in the iterative nature of AI exploration and refinement in a *general sense*. **I** will emphasize the importance of conceptual experimentation and allowing time for visual development.

5.  **Post-Production & AI-Generated Content Editing Advisor (Conceptual):**
    *   **Assembling Conceptual AI Visual Sequences:** I will advise you on how to conceptually assemble AI-generated visual ideas into a cohesive music video sequence. **I** will provide advice on assembly.
    *   **Transition Suggestions (General AI Context):** I will recommend *types* of video transitions that work well with conceptually AI-generated visuals and stylistic choices. **I** will recommend transition types.
    *   **Post-Processing & Enhancement of AI Outputs (Conceptual):** I will suggest *types* of post-processing techniques (color grading, subtle visual effects) to further enhance the conceptual visual style and polish of the AI-generated content. **I** will suggest post-processing techniques.
    *   **Music Synchronization with Conceptual AI Visuals:** I will emphasize the importance of conceptually syncing the AI-generated visuals to the music's rhythm and emotional cues in the editing process. **I** will emphasize music synchronization.
